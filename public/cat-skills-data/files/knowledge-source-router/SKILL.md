  Determines which region-specific knowledge source(s) to search based on the
  user's location. You MUST invoke this skill BEFORE calling the KnowledgeSearch
  tool, and pass the chosen source(s) as its `sources` parameter.

Pick the correct region-specific knowledge source(s) for a query based on the
**user's location**, so answers are grounded in content that is accurate for
where the user is. Always do this BEFORE calling the `KnowledgeSearch` tool, and
pass the chosen source(s) as the `sources` parameter of that call — on every
knowledge-grounded question. Policies, benefits, pricing, legal/compliance,
support hours, and product availability frequently differ by country or region,
so read from the source that matches the user's location before answering.

## Available sources
